# Notes: This will include basics of how someone can engage with the project: what it is, how to set it up, which development environment to use, what dependencies to watch out for, etc.

# Topics covered in a project setup doc can range from technical requirements to the libraries used, necessary tools, and connected database.

# Other things to include are: 
# Project description
# How to get the project running
# Project dependencies (e.g., JavaScript version, ESLint rules)
# Which API the project uses
